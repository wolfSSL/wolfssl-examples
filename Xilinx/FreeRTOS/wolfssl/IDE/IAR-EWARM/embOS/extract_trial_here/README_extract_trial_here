This trial can be found here:

Look for the Download for IAR compiler and Cortex M

The title should be: "embOS trial for Cortex-M and IAR compiler"



*** For custom port ***
The trial will still be located at: https://www.segger.com/downloads/embos

However you will need to identify and download the correct project for your
