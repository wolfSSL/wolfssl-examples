Shows examples of how to work with storing and loading keys after they have been generated. ecc_keys.c creates a key structure than stores the private key in DER formate. After storing the private key it then loads it back into a ecc_key struct. ecc_keys.c also shows how to export and import public keys.

The build option used for wolfSSL is

./configure --enable-keygen --enable-ecc
