This is an example of adding the wolfSSL library as a subdirectory to a project
and using cmake to build. Each subdirectory has a README file on how to build the example.

## Example Builds:

- user-settings-example (contains a very bare user_settings.h example)
- caam-nxp-example (contains an example of building with NXP SDK and CAAM)
