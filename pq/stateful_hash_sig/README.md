# wolfSSL Post-Quantum Cryptography Stateful Hash-based Signatures Example

This directory contains:

- An example that uses wolfCrypt LMS/HSS to sign and verify a
  message with configurable LMS/HSS parameters. Requires wolfssl with
  `--enable-lms`.

- An example that uses wolfCrypt XMSS/XMSS^MT to sign and verify a
  message with a configurable XMSS/XMSS^MT parameter string. Requires wolfssl
  with `--enable-xmss`.

By default these examples use the wolfCrypt LMS and XMSS implementations
(`wc_lms.c`, `wc_lms_impl.c`, `wc_xmss.c`, `wc_xmss_impl.c`), which are more
performant and configurable. Also, these implementations benefit significantly
from `--enable-intelasm` and `--enable-armasm`.

If you want to use the old external integrations (`ext_lms.c`, `ext_xmss.c`),
see the section "Building the External Integration examples".

## Signing and Verifying a Message with LMS/HSS

This example will generate an LMS/HSS key pair with L=levels, H=height, and
W=Winternitz parameters, then sign and verify a given number of signatures.
It will also print the signature size, the total number of signatures, and
the public and private key lengths.

While LMS/HSS have small public and private keys, and fast signing and
verifying, the initial key generation can be quite slow and intensive,
especially for larger heights and Winternitz parameters.

LMS/HSS signature systems have a finite number of one-time signatures (OTS).
The number of available signatures is
  N = 2 ** (levels * height)

The supported parameter values are those in RFC8554:
- levels = {1..8}
- height = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}
- Winternitz = {1, 2, 4, 8}

To see the help and usage, run the program without options:
```sh
$./lms_example
usage:
  ./lms_example <levels> <height> <winternitz> [num signatures]

examples:
  ./lms_example 1 5 1
  ./lms_example 3 5 4 100
  ./lms_example 2 10 2 0

## Generate an LMS private/public key pair

This example generates an LMS public/private key pair and stores them to file.

```sh
$./lms-kg
Levels: 1, Height: 10, Winternitz: 4
  Writing to file: lms_key.bin
  Writing to file: lms_pubkey.bin

$./lms-kg --params 54
Using parameters: LMS/HSS_SHA256/192_L1_H20_W4
  Writing to file: lms_key.bin
  Writing to file: lms_pubkey.bin
```

## Sign files with LMS private key

This example uses an LMS private key to sign multiple files.

```sh
$./lms-sign Makefile README.md
Levels: 1, Height: 10, Winternitz: 4
  Reading from file: lms_key.bin
    Read 56 bytes
Ready to sign
  Reading from file: Makefile
    Read 2455 bytes
  Writing to file: lms_key.bin
  Writing to file: Makefile.sig
  Reading from file: README.md
    Read 7756 bytes
  Writing to file: lms_key.bin
  Writing to file: README.md.sig

$./lms-sign --params 54 Makefile README.md
Using parameters: LMS/HSS_SHA256/192_L1_H20_W4
  Reading from file: lms_key.bin
    Read 56 bytes
Ready to sign
  Reading from file: Makefile
    Read 2455 bytes
  Writing to file: lms_key.bin
  Writing to file: Makefile.sig
  Reading from file: README.md
    Read 7756 bytes
  Writing to file: lms_key.bin
  Writing to file: README.md.sig
```

## Verify file with LMS public key

This example uses an LMS public key to verify a file against its signature.

```sh
$./lms-verify README.md
Levels: 1, Height: 10, Winternitz: 4
  Reading from file: lms_pubkey.bin
    Read 52 bytes
  Reading from file: README.md
    Read 7756 bytes
  Reading from file: README.md.sig
    Read 1744 bytes
Verification succeeded

$./lms-verify --params 54 README.md
Using parameters: LMS/HSS_SHA256/192_L1_H20_W4
  Reading from file: lms_pubkey.bin
    Read 52 bytes
  Reading from file: README.md
    Read 7756 bytes
  Reading from file: README.md.sig
    Read 1744 bytes
Verification succeeded
```

## Signing and Verifying a Message with XMSS/XMSS^MT

To see the help and usage, run the program without options:
```sh
$ ./xmss_example
usage:
  ./xmss_example <param string> [num signatures]

examples:
  ./xmss_example XMSSMT-SHA2_20/4_256 5
  ./xmss_example XMSSMT-SHA2_60/6_256 100
  ./xmss_example XMSS-SHA2_10_256 1023
```

The param string may be any name from this table:

```
         ----------------------------------------------------------
         | Name                     Oid         n   w  len  h   d  |
 XMSS:   | "XMSS-SHA2_10_256"       0x00000001  32  16  67  10  1  |
         | "XMSS-SHA2_16_256"       0x00000002  32  16  67  16  1  |
         | "XMSS-SHA2_20_256"       0x00000003  32  16  67  20  1  |
         |                                                         |
 XMSSMT: | "XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256"   0x00000001  32  16  67  20  2  |
         | "XMSSMT-SHA2_20/4_256"   0x00000002  32  16  67  20  4  |
         | "XMSSMT-SHA2_40/2_256"   0x00000003  32  16  67  40  2  |
         | "XMSSMT-SHA2_40/4_256"   0x00000004  32  16  67  40  4  |
         | "XMSSMT-SHA2_40/8_256"   0x00000005  32  16  67  40  8  |
         | "XMSSMT-SHA2_60/3_256"   0x00000006  32  16  67  60  3  |
         | "XMSSMT-SHA2_60/6_256"   0x00000007  32  16  67  60  6  |
         | "XMSSMT-SHA2_60/12_256"  0x00000008  32  16  67  60  12 |
         ----------------------------------------------------------
```

Here `n=32` is the number of bytes in the SHA256 has function, `w=16`
is the Winternitz parameter, `len=67` is the length of Winternitz chains,
`h` is the is the total height of the tree or hyper-tree, and `d` is the
number of levels in the hyper-tree. The number of signatures available
is `N = 2 ** (h)`.

The main contributor to key generation time is the ratio `h/d`.
Not surprisingly, be aware that `XMSS-SHA2_20_256`, and `XMSSMT-SHA2_60/3_256`,
are particularly CPU intensive because of the large number of hash operations
involved, and may take a long time.

The other examples will be much faster.

An interesting facet of XMSS/XMSS^MT is that the private key format
and size is implementation specific. The wolfSSL XMSS/XMSS^MT default
implementation has larger private key sizes for greater signing
performance.

For example this is obtained with the default `-enable-xmss` with
`--enable-intelasm` (on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz):

```
$time ./xmss_example  "XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256" 200
using parameters: XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256
signature length: 4963
priv key length: 5780
pub key length: 68
making key with XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256 parameters...
...done!
signing and verifying 200 signatures...
...done!
finished

real	0m2.115s
user	0m2.104s
sys	0m0.007s
```

Versus the same with `--enable-xmss=small` instead:

```
$time ./xmss_example  "XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256" 200
using parameters: XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256
signature length: 4963
priv key length: 135
pub key length: 68
making key with XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256 parameters...
...done!
signing and verifying 200 signatures...
...done!
finished

real	6m57.413s
user	6m56.337s
sys	0m0.058s
```

## Using the verify-only XMSS/XMSS^MT example

The verify-only XMSS example requires that wolfSSL has been built with
`--enable-xmss=verify-only`. The usage for the verify-only example is:
```
$ ./xmss_example
usage:
  ./xmss_example <param string> <pub file> <sig file> <msg file>

For simplicity message is assumed to be 32 bytes in size.

examples:
  ./xmss_example XMSSMT-SHA2_20/4_256 xmss_pub.key xmss_sig.bin msg.bin
  ./xmss_example XMSSMT-SHA2_60/6_256 xmss_pub.key xmss_sig.bin msg.bin
  ./xmss_example XMSS-SHA2_10_256 xmss_pub.key xmss_sig.bin msg.bin
```

An example:
```
$./xmss_example XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256 pk.bin sig.bin msg.bin
using parameters: XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256

# Building the External Integration examples

By default wolfssl uses the wolfCrypt LMS/XMSS implementations. However
the previous external integrations are still supported.

If building with `--with-liblms=<path>`, the LMS/HSS example requires
that hash-sigs has been built.  Please see Item 17 in the wolfSSL repo's INSTALL file.

https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/INSTALL

If building with `--with-libxmss=<path>`, the XMSS/XMSS^MT example requires
that the xmss-reference repository has been cloned, patched, and built. Please
see item 20 in the wolfSSL repo's INSTALL file.

The patch to use is `0001-Patch-to-support-wolfSSL-xmss-reference-integration.patch`
from this XMSS/XMSS^MT example.  This patch includes an addendum readme,
`patch_readme.md`, that lists all changes made and explains their rationale.

## Building the external LMS/HSS example

If building with `--with-liblms=<path>`, configure the Makefile to point
to your hash-sigs install:

```
HSS_INC  = <path to hss install>
```

```
HSS_LIB         = <path to hss_lib_thread.a>
```

Then build:

```
$ make lms_example
```

## Building the external XMSS/XMSS^MT example

If building with `--with-libxmss=<path>`, configure the Makefile to point to
your xmss install:

```
XMSS_INC = <path to patched xmss install>
```

```
XMSS_LIB = <path to xmss_lib.a or xmss_verify_lib.a>
```

Then build:

```
$ make xmss_example
```
