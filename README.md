wolfSSL Example Applications
============================

This repository contains example applications, written in C, which
demonstrate how to use the wolfSSL lightweight SSL/TLS library for secure
communication.

Each directory represents a unique topic (SSL/TLS, DTLS, PSK, etc.) and
contains a Makefile as well as a simple tutorial on the given topic.

## Current Examples


#### android (Android Studio and NDK Examples)

This directory contains examples that demonstrate using wolfSSL,
wolfSSL JNI/JSSE, and wolfCrypt JNI/JCE on the Android platform. Examples
use either Android Studio with Gradle or the Android NDK standalone toolchain.

Please see the [android/README.md](android/README.md) for further usage and 
details.

<br />

#### BTLE

This directory contains examples for securing a Bluetooth Low Energy Link (BTLE).
BTLE packets are small and throughput is low, so these examples demonstrate a
way to exchange data securely without BTLE pairing.

<br />

#### can-bus

This directory contains an example echo server/client using wolfSSL over

## Notes


When necessary, examples will use the example certificates and keys located
in the ./certs directory. These certificates and keys have been pulled in from
the main wolfSSL repository.

To generate your own cert text, see the [DER to C script](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/scripts/dertoc.pl).
